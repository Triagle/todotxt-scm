#+TITLE: Todo.txt CLI for Chicken Scheme
* What is it?
A [[http://todotxt.com/][todo.txt]] client written in Chicken Scheme for those lisp completionists
* Why is it?
Because I can. Also for some peculiar reason the official CLI doesn't work for
me.
* Examples
This program is functionally equivalent to the actual shell script, anything
that would work there will work with this.
