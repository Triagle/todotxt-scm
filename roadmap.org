#+TITLE: Roadmap

A roadmap of the features I wish to have at some point.
* Tasks
- [ ] Blocking tasks
  - Similar to blocking tasks in taskwarrior, in that certain tasks can block the completion of
    another
- [ ] Retain typed input order
  - Not sure how useful this is? idk but nice to have
* UI
- [ ] Tree output
  - Prints tasks as a tree output like the =tree= command
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      .
      ├── GTD
      │   └──  1 weekly review recur:1 +gtd
      ├── 2 (C) Get milk @shops
      ├── 3 (D) Take out trash @home
      └── Todo.txt-scm
          ├── 4 (A) Blocking tasks +todo.txt-scm
          └── 5 (B) Tree output +todo.txt-scm
    #+END_EXAMPLE
- [ ] Highlighted output
  - Prints tasks as highlighted output like the original todo.txt client
  - Something like the terminal output
    in[[http://todotxt.com/images/todotxt-apps_lrg.png][ this screenshot]]
* Enhancements
- [ ] Dumb print when piping to other programs.
  - Currently piped output is not stripped of it's colour, which hampers it when
    piping to other programs. Probably shouldn't do that.
- [ ] Cool logo
  - The terminal screenshot is fairly unreadable
